# Useful Tricks & Techniques I've gathered   

## Grab every two numbers in array

**Nested Loops**
- Outer loop grabs first number.
- Inner loop grabs second number.

## Need for HashTable. 
- Create the hashTable (Object).
- Loop through the given input.
- Check values against the hashTables keys.
- If values not found throw values in the hashTable as keys.
- Use square brackets to add new keys to the hashTable.
- True and indexes can be added as values.

## Validating Sequences of an array
- Useful to create pointers to track position.
- Combine that and looping to grab desired numbers.
- Remember to perform operations as long as we are in the boundaries of let's say for example an array.
- Move seq pointer when match is found.
- Move original pointer no matter if match is found.
- Once the loop is done return the seq pointer is the same as the sequence length.
- That will give us a nice true or false.
