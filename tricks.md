# Useful Tricks & Techniques I've gathered   

## Grab every two numbers in array

**Nested Loops**
- Outer loop grabs first number.
- Inner loop grabs second number.

## Need for HashTable. 
- Create the hashTable (Object).
- Loop through the given input.
- Check values against the hashTables keys.
- If values not found throw values in the hashTable as keys.
- Use square brackets to add new keys to the hashTable.
- True and indexes can be added as values.
